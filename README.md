# 3D-Graphics-Engine-v2

### A new version of my old 3D engine (Work in progress)
Writing a graphics engine was a fun excercise but the one I wrote last winter wasn't designed very well. It was pretty much just a bunch of code hacked together hoping that it works while adding (and learning about) as many features as possible. But now that I actually know a bit about rendering graphics, I'm trying to put a little more effort to designign the software. I'll try to encapsulate the classes a bit better and try using some new design patterns.
